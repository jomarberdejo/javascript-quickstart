This site is designed to provide a quick and easy tutorial for beginners who want to learn JavaScript from scratch. It includes the following pages:

- Home
- Variables

The site is supported by a set of CSS and JS files that ensure its layout and functionality are optimized for the best user experience:

## CSS
- `main.css`
- `content.css`
- `dialog.css`
- `index.css`
- `quiz.css`

## JS
- `script.js`

- `quiz.js`

## Dependencies

- icon icons

While the site is responsive to most screen sizes, I'm still working on making it accessible to everyone.

Throughout the development of this site, I sought help from various resources to ensure that the content is accurate and easy to understand. These include:

- Google Classroom materials provided by our teacher
- Quillbot (for proper grammar and use of sentences)
- ChatGPT (particularly for the topics definition, examples, and clarification and syntax to use)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

I also referenced these resources for syntax and local storage usage examples for the quiz page. Although I encountered challenges along the way, I was able to overcome them with the help of these resources.

This site is open to anyone who wants to learn JavaScript from scratch. I hope it serves as a useful starting point for your web development journey. Good luck and enjoy!

More content will be added in the future.
